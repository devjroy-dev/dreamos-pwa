// (the wedding calendar is dream-os's own table; engine.events is an audit log,
// not a calendar). Vendor metadata comes from req.vendor + public.users.
// Slicing, shape, and counts are identical to the live handler, so Phase 4 can
// flip the path without the pwa noticing.

    // F-2b2.3 listed this slice for retirement on the ground that its readers were the old
    // /vendor tree's pages. THE PREMISE WAS WRONG, and the correction is on the record as
    // FORK 4: the readers were the SHELL's — leads/body.tsx, events/body.tsx and the invoices
    // masthead — and they were cured at the shell in P7.2 ZIP 1, not deleted with the tree.
    // The proof is `tsc --noEmit` on dreamos-pwa at 405f962, where dropping `paid`/`owed` from
    // `CabinetResponse` named exactly one remaining reader (`derive.ts::moneyBinders`), which
    // retired with them. The invoices figure now comes from money.js's own summary
    // (OUTSTANDING_STATES — the one rule, server-side).

    // ── F-04.13 (CE-RATIFIED 2026-07-15) — THE money rule ────────────────
    // CANON lives in dreamos-pwa/lib/vendor/derive.ts :: pendingOf(). This is
    // its mirror; the two must never diverge (they are one rule, written twice
    // only because they live in different repos).
    //
    //   pending = amount_pending ?? max(amount - amount_received, 0)   [direction 'in' only]
    //
    // WHY: money filed through Victor's donna_money door sets `amount` and
    // never touches the settlement cells; only money-edit writes those. The old
    // predicate (`amount_pending > 0`) therefore read an UNFILED cell as ZERO
    // OWED — hiding Rs 85,000 across two unpaid clients (Dev Roy 2, Keka), who
    // appeared on NO money surface at all while the cabinet drawer, which
    // inferred, showed the truth. The CE's words: "an unfiled cell means
    // unfiled, not Rs 0." Explicit cells still win when present — a binder
    // filed as settled (pending 0) stays settled.
    //
    // The direction guard is load-bearing: without it an expense binder
    // (direction 'out', amount 5000, no cells) would infer Rs 5,000 "owed".

    // deriveEventsThisWeek — this payload IS the drawer's source, so the
    // predicate belongs where the rows are chosen).
    //

    // the calendar" (founder SQL: __calendar_check__ and Meera - call, both
    // cancelled, both shown — drawer said 3, truth was 1). A cancelled date is
    // a SELLABLE date; claiming it is occupied costs the vendor work.
    // `done` does NOT count either, per the ruling: "on the calendar" answers
    // what's ahead; history lives in timelines.
