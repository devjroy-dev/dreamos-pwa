// scripts/lib/mutateCopy.mjs — ONE HOME for mutating a copy instead of production
// source. F-19.18 (pwa) and F-38.38 (dream-os) are the same finding in two repos;
// this file and `dream-os/scripts/lib/mutateCopy.js` are the same shape in two
// module systems, the way `stripComments` already is.
//
// ── WHAT WENT WRONG, IN BOTH REPOS, AND WHY A `finally` IS NOT THE CURE ──────
//
// The estate's non-vacuity doctrine is right and the benches implement it
// correctly: mutate real production source, run the cells in a fresh process,
// assert they go RED, restore in a `finally`, then assert the restore was
// byte-identical. Read on the page it is airtight.
//
// A `finally` GUARDS A THROW. IT DOES NOT GUARD A SIGNAL. `timeout`, Ctrl-C, an
// OOM kill, a codespace restart — the process ends before the restore runs and
// production source is left holding the mutation. The bench's own restoration
// cell cannot catch it, because the process that would run it is gone.
//
// Both repos have now been bitten, on real seats, in ways that cost days:
//
//   F-19.18 · `app/coplanner/CircleSessionContext.tsx` kept an injected
//   `permissions: { can_see_budget: boolean };` from `tdw07_f0772_circle`'s
//   mutation leg. The bench then reddened ITSELF on the vocabulary it had
//   planted. Withdrawing the delivery did not clear it — the contamination
//   survived the withdrawal — so the red read as somebody else's for a full
//   sitting.
//
//   F-38.38 · `src/engine/src/core/donna.ts` kept `stampOf(it)` stripped from a
//   vendor-facing line by `b06_m1_bench.js`. That diff is PLAUSIBLE: a dropped
//   timestamp reads as a deliberate copy edit, not as corruption, and it would
//   have survived review.
//
// ── THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS THE COPY AND NOT A SIGNAL HANDLER ───────────────
//
// F-38.38 priced both cures and preferred this one in its own words: *a bench
// that never writes to production source cannot leave it dirty however it dies.*
// A `process.on('SIGTERM')` restore is strictly better than nothing, but it is
// still a race — SIGKILL takes no handler, and a handler that throws mid-restore
// leaves a half-written file, which is worse than the mutation it was curing.
//
// So the mutation happens in a SHADOW TREE and production source is never opened
// for writing at all. The shadow is a symlink farm: every top-level entry of the
// repo is a symlink back to the real one, so the child process reads the real
// tree for everything it does not mutate and pays no copy cost for it. Only the
// path down to a mutated file is materialised — the directories become real
// directories of symlinks, and the mutated file itself becomes a real file with
// the mutated bytes. A tree of eleven thousand files costs one directory of
// links plus one real file per mutation.
//
// THE SIGNAL ARM SURVIVES ANYWAY, and it is not redundant: `dispose()` is wired
// to SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP/SIGQUIT and to `exit`, so a killed run removes its own
// shadow instead of leaving temp dirs behind. The difference is what a MISSED
// dispose costs. Under the old shape it cost production source. Under this one it
// costs an orphaned directory in `os.tmpdir()`, which the OS reaps and no
// `git status` will ever show.
//
// ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// It does not convert any bench by itself, and the two conversions shipped
// beside it are the two that were actually bitten. A 51-file sweep of the
// estate's safety machinery was priced and refused at CE-38 S3: a mass edit
// whose own non-vacuity cannot be proven in one sitting is exactly the shape
// D-38.1 warns about, and the machinery being swept is the machinery that
// catches everything else. Benches adopt this as they are touched, and each
// conversion proves its own non-vacuity at its own site.
