// CE-39 · ROAD STEP 2b · 2b-2 · THE ENGINE MOUNTS, ASSERTED AS STANDING.
//
// ── ⚠ THIS CELL IS INVERTED, AND THE INVERSION IS THE RULING ────────────────
// It was written to prove a RETIREMENT and it ships proving the opposite: that
// the four engine money addresses ALL STILL RESOLVE. Nothing is retired by 2b-2
// and this file is the guard against one happening by accident.
//
// THE RETIREMENT WAS RULED, BUILT, AND WITHDRAWN — F-2b2.3. The charter would
// have dropped `cabinet.js`'s `paid`/`owed` slices and the two `/vendor-e/` GET
// mounts, on a callers-down sweep that reported ZERO pwa readers. The sweep was
// a grep and the grep was wrong: dropping the two fields from `CabinetResponse`
// made `tsc` name THREE live readers in one run —
//   dreamos-pwa lib/vendor/derive.ts:100        `moneyBinders` composes its whole
//                                               result from cab.paid + cab.owed
//   dreamos-pwa app/vendor/list/[slice]/leads.tsx:96    all four slices
//   dreamos-pwa app/vendor/list/[slice]/events.tsx:36   all four slices
// — none of which the grep could see, because it alternated on variable names
// and could not read `cab.data?.paid` or a spread inside an array literal.
//
// THE LAW THAT CAME OUT OF IT (band 5): **a grep's failure mode is a silent
// zero; a type resolver's is an error. For consumers of a typed wire, `tsc` IS
// the sweep and grep is the hint.**
//
// The `/vendor-e/` mounts have zero callers and were proven safe to retire by
// request, both ways. They are HELD anyway, by ruling: the same sweep-shape
// produced this sitting's finding, they cost nothing standing, and Phase 7
// retires the whole vendor-engine twin — mounts, slices and the three
// /vendor-tree readers — in ONE motion, at a tip where `readers leave before
// their sources` can be proven by `tsc` on both sides at once.
//
// ── WHAT THE CELLS ASSERT NOW ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//   · `/api/v2/vendor-e/{cabinet,binders}` (GET) — STILL MOUNTED.
//   · `/api/v2/vendor-e/binders` POST doors — STILL MOUNTED, same prefix.
//   · `/api/v2/vendor/{cabinet,binders}` — STILL MOUNTED and LIVE; these are
//     what `fetchCabinet` and `fetchLedger` call.
// An accidental retirement of any of them reds here with the reader named.
//
// ⚠ §1 MOUNTS THE REAL ROUTERS AND ISSUES REAL REQUESTS. It does not read the
// mount table and reason about Express: a claim about behaviour is derived from
// behaviour (R-38.19's shape). A 404 and a 401 are different answers and these
// cells distinguish them, because a door that exists and refuses you is mounted
// and a door that does not exist is not.
//
// ── ⚠ THE INERT ENV, SET BEFORE ANY REQUIRE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A CREDENTIAL ──
// `src/engine/dist/core/db.js` throws at MODULE LOAD if SUPABASE_URL and
// SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY are unset, and the vendor router's import graph
// reaches it. The values below are OBVIOUS PLACEHOLDERS and are never used: every
// door §1 hits authenticates first and answers 401 or 404 long before a query,
// and `app.locals.supabase` is left null so a handler that DID reach the database
// would throw loudly rather than talk to one.
//
// No live credential is echoed, read from the environment, or written to a
// transcript by this file — the secrets law, and the reason the constants are
// spelled to be unmistakable rather than realistic. They are set only if unset,
// so a real environment is never overwritten by a bench.
